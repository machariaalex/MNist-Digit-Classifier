# MNist-Digit-Classifier
Using deep learning to perform digit classifier
MNIST Digit Classifier
This project is a machine learning model that classifies digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library.
Requirements
•	Python 3.x
•	Numpy
•	Matplotlib
•	Scikit-learn
Usage
1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/[username]/mnist-digit-classifier.git
2.	Install the required libraries:
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
3.	Run the script:
python mnist_classifier.py
The script will train a support vector machine (SVM) on the MNIST data, evaluate its performance on a test set, and visualize the results using matplotlib.

Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test set.

Credits
The MNIST dataset used in this project was obtained from Yann LeCun's website.
